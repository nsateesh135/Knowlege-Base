/*
Tesla is investigating production bottlenecks and they need your help to extract the relevant data. Write a query that determines which parts with the assembly steps have initiated the assembly process but remain unfinished.

Assumptions:

parts_assembly table contains all parts currently in production, each at varying stages of the assembly process.
An unfinished part is one that lacks a finish_date.
This question is straightforward, so let's approach it with simplicity in both thinking and solution

parts_assembly Table
Column Name	Type
part	string
finish_date	datetime
assembly_step	integer

parts_assembly Example Input
part	finish_date	assembly_step
battery	01/22/2022 00:00:00	1
battery	02/22/2022 00:00:00	2
battery	03/22/2022 00:00:00	3
bumper	01/22/2022 00:00:00	1
bumper	02/22/2022 00:00:00	2
bumper		3
bumper		4

Example Output
part	assembly_step
bumper	3
bumper	4

*/

SELECT 
part,
assembly_step
FROM parts_assembly
WHERE finish_date is  null
;
