# basic means of debugging is by printing comments to the console

# Breakpoint : The point in code where I want to examine data 
# Step Over : Moves to the next line in code after the breakpoint line
# Step Out : Brings us to the place where the function was called
# Step Into: Executes code by stepping into a function being called

# Debugging in vs code 
# Open Debug menu -> Run and Debug -> Choose file type(Python)

# Watch 
# To watch values in a variable 
"""Just type in an expression and you can watch output for instance 
   lets say I have a variable num to see slice of data in num I can type num[:5]
   we can even type expression like 7<5, this will work
"""

# call stack 
# Indicated sequence on code being debugged 
# Something like I am on function1() if I step out I'll go to function2()
